# Lots of Piexels Studios

Our organisation is a service provider for Minecraft addon development, providing services from development, level design to 3d-art as well as software supporting supporting other organisations that work in the same field.

Our main project is called Monstera, which is an sdk supporting you with developing, organizing your resources and packaging (for Auger).

With Monstera you can:
- Develop Minecraft addons (without JSON syntax issues)
- Writing the code needed for an entity in only one file, making it a lot clearer
- Organize and structure your resources as you want (for example every resource for an entity in ONE directory)
- Make use of the features of a higher programming language
- Automatically build skinpacks
- Package your project for Auger
- Save a huge amount of time!
